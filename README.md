NEXT/TODO
- half price has variants! see photos
  - may not be needed on ledger? only on till?
- add group discount (if Carrie says it's needed on ledger record)
- better zoom controls; labelled? default 1.5?
  - or just fix at 150% as that's ideal?
- use localstorage to persist? (may not need to if never navigate)
- notes? e.g upgrade to membership
- figure out how gonna manage submissions
  - with ability to edit?
- web app would be preferable, remove confusion of browser interface
- gift aid price col in SS
- Add worksheet showing totals per day
- Link (from menu?) to spreadsheet
  - Pippa can share login with Shirley/Carrie/anyone she trusts to make changes
- Also link to GitHub/documentation?
- Remove key from code base


Shirley feedback / My observations
- not entered in spreadsheet
  - dogs, prices, pre-booked, Â£1 children (just overall children figure)
- Shirley needed very little guidance, but still she couple times wasn't sure what she needed to do next
  - consider more google forms type interface where presented with one "question" at a time
- keyboard popping up is likely (other than browser distractions) most troublesome aspect. therefore consider alternative to text input for postcode... somehow
- browser. address bar, tabs, other buttons just create opportunity for users to get themselves in trouble
  - app?
- some lady on Saturday also uses ledger to input something on computer
  - ask Carrie
  
Pete/James
- minus smaller than plus (try different font)
- tab order to avoid shirley issue of tabbing to Reason for Visit?
- prevent double-tap zoom if possible
- order of select items
