NEXT/TODO
-
- dont allow submission if only dogs!
- consider changing ui: choose num adults, children, dogs, then specify adult types
- build visitor inputs from model
- clear form/start again
- better zoom controls; labelled? default 1.5?
  - or just fix at 150% as that's ideal?
  - use localstorage to persist? (may not need to if never navigate)
- notes? e.g upgrade to membership
- maybe a visual indicator of adults and children; little human icons
- maybe dropdown with common postcodes, even poss eg. "Tiverton (EX16)"
- figure out how gonna manage submissions
  - with ability to edit?
- prevent unauthorised access
