NEXT/TODO
- Prevent navigation
- review Pippa reports
- better zoom controls; labelled? default 1.5?
  - or just fix at 150% as that's ideal?
- use localstorage to persist? (may not need to if never navigate)
- notes? e.g upgrade to membership
- figure out how gonna manage submissions
  - with ability to edit?
- web app would be preferable, remove confusion of browser interface
  - see android studio project
- Add worksheet showing totals per day
- Link (from menu?) to spreadsheet
  - Pippa can share login with Shirley/Carrie/anyone she trusts to make changes
- Also link to GitHub/documentation?
- Remove key from code base


Shirley feedback / My observations
- not entered in spreadsheet
  - dogs, prices, pre-booked, £1 children (just overall children figure)
- Shirley needed very little guidance, but still she couple times wasn't sure what she needed to do next
- keyboard popping up is likely (other than browser distractions) most troublesome aspect. therefore consider alternative to text input for postcode... somehow
- some lady on Saturday also uses ledger to input something on computer
  - ask Carrie
  
Pete/James
- tab order to avoid shirley issue of tabbing to Reason for Visit?
- prevent double-tap zoom if possible
- order of select items
