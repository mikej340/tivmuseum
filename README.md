NEXT/TODO
-
- readonly numeric inputs to basically prevent keyboard showing up (kb showing up is what concerns me most; staff may get confused)
- dont allow submission if only dogs!
- consider changing ui: choose num adults, children, dogs, then specify adult types
- build visitor inputs from model
- better zoom controls; labelled? default 1.5?
  - or just fix at 150% as that's ideal?
  - use localstorage to persist? (may not need to if never navigate)
- notes? e.g upgrade to membership
- maybe a visual indicator of adults and children; little human icons
- maybe dropdown with common postcodes, even poss eg. "Tiverton (EX16)"
- figure out how gonna manage submissions
  - with ability to edit?
- prevent unauthorised access
  - https://www.authgear.com/post/add-authentication-to-any-web-page-in-10-minutes ?
- web app would be preferable, remove confusion of browser interface

Shirley feedback / My observations
- not entered in spreadsheet
  - dogs, prices, pre-booked, Â£1 children (just overall children figure)
- Shirley needed very little guidance, but still she couple times wasn't sure what she needed to do next
  - consider more google forms type interface where presented with one "question" at a time
- keyboard popping up is likely (other than browser distractions) most troublesome aspect. therefore consider alternative to text input for postcode... somehow
- browser. address bar, tabs, other buttons just create opportunity for users to get themselves in trouble
  - app?
- when fullscreen (eg when scroll down in chrome) 1x zoom everything fits perfectly in the viewport!
- some lady on Saturday also uses ledger to input something on computer
  - ask Carrie

Pete/James
- 
- minus smaller than plus (try different font)
- tab order to avoid shirley issue of tabbing to Reason for Visit?
- consider lower-casing
- prevent double-tap zoom if possible
- order of select items
- just show gift aid number in dropdown
