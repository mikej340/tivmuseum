FOH priority
- Next Saturday half price event
  - Events column maybe, and maybe ability to set up and configure events
- end of day totals
- Retry on fetch error (other than unauthorised)
- Postcode submit button still hidden behind keyboard (not now that it’s in kiosk mode)
- After putting in auth key, keyboard can’t be dismissed

FOH
- SURELY if reason for visit is local wherever that local option is then the how you heard about us is always local resident or else local resident shouldn't be a how you heard about us option
- Might as well remove the letters and numbers from the drop-downs
- More consideration around how did you hear about us vs how did you hear about X event
